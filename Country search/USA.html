                    In Pennsylvania, communities of Amish live in a way that has changed little since the 18th century. The Amish are descended from Swiss-German Christians who came to the United States to find religious freedom. They follow a strict form of Christianity and shun most modern technology.

                    The manufacturing assembly line was invented in the United States by Henry Ford at his automobile plant in Michigan in the 1920s. Today, most manufacturing uses this method of production.

                    Before 1947, black players were restricted to what were called the Negro Leagues. Jackie Robinson was the first African-American to play major league baseball. He signed up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947 after playing in Montreal for two years.  By the 1990s the majority of MVP winners in both the American and National Leagues were African American.

                    Mount Rushmore represents the largest work of art on earth. The presidents' noses are 20 feet long, each mouth is 18 feet wide, and each eye is 11 feet across.
